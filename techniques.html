    <p>
      <h3>SQL injection:</h3>
      sql injection is one of the first things you'll learn on the road to being a pentester.
      The idea is that many times, a web designer will haphazardly connect their databases with
      their websites witout properly sanitizing the input. This usually happens in a login field
      but can be present in any interface where the users input is used directly in an SQL query.
      The results of an SQL injection attack can range anywhere from a login bypass to, in extreme
      cases, full server compromiseA pentester's job is to learn how to recognize and take full
      advantage of this vulnerabilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>LFI/RFI:</h3>
      LFI stands for local file injection.  RFI stands for remote file injection.  These
      vulnerabilities allow a pentester to introduce new php code into a website environment, and
      are the result of improper use of the includes() php function.  A RFI vulnerability will allow
      a pentester to introduce a php file directly from his own web server, while an LFI
      vulnerability forces a pentester to be a little more clever about his/her attack, usually
      finding ways to introduce code through a log file or an improperly sanitized database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>XSS:</h3>
      XSS stands for cross-site scripting, and is what is known as a client side attack.  Like an
      SQL injection attack, this vulnerability is the result of not sanitizing user input, usually
      in a form or other public forum.  The pentester will take advantage of certain javascript
      techniques, such as invisible iframes to redirect an unsuspecting client to a malicious site.
