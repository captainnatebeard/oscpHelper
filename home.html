    <p>
      This site should help you prepare, and act as a handy reference guide during the test.
      The PWK test is a grueling 24 hour ordeal that will leave you physically and mentally drained,
      but if you're prepared, and are willing to try harder, you <em>will</em> come out on the
      other side, an OSCP certified Pentester.
